# Convex Hull
### Christian Tropeano, Thomas Fargnoli, Benjamin Chau
This final project for our Data Structures and Abstractions Class involves us implementing convex hulls using Graham's Scan Algorithm.
We used the programming language C++ in order to implement the algorithm. This repo includes our project report as well as our presentation.
## **How to Run our Project**:
### Prerequisites:
- Have Visual Studios Community installed, [you will need the 2017 version](https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?q=visual%20studio%202017&wt.mc_id=o~msft~vscom~older-downloads).
- [Install SFML on machine](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.0/)
