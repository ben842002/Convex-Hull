# Convex Hull
### Christian Tropeano, Thomas Fargnoli, Benjamin Chau
This final project for our Data Structures and Abstractions Class involves us implementing convex hulls using Graham's Scan Algorithm.
We used the programming language C++ in order to implement the algorithm. This repo also involves our project report as well as our presentations.
## How to Run our Project:
### Prerequisites:
- Have Visual Studios Community installed and updated to the latest version.
- Have C++
- Install SFML on machine
