- talk about how we implemented convex hull
    - using vectors, tuples, libraries 
- draw a convex and non-convex polygon on the board (do the straight line test)
- run through conevex hull examples (1-2 difficult ones)
- talk about the applications of convex hull (collision avoidance, robot planning)
- talk about bucket sort and how we implemented it
- talk about the different kinds of algorithms to find convex hulls
- go into detail about the graham scan part of the program
- leave ~3 min left to answer questions from the crowd
